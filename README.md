# Login_System
Desktop application design that interacts with MS SQL database and opens a new page to the user by querying username/password.

Hello there,

I am here with a desktop application that I did in my software internship.
It was a very exciting experience as it is an interactive application with the database.
The application compares the information stored in the MS Sql server database with user logins.
If wrong username and password are entered, the system gives a warning. When logged in correctly, a new page opens to the user.


So how is this software used?

If you are writing a desktop application and want to customize your software, you can use this application. 
You can use it as an introduction to your project.

See you later,
